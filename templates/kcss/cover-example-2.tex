What is the worst overall degradation due to the absence of central authority
or a lack of cooperation
when individuals (called \term{players}) use or form a network?
\enquote{Distributed operation} is our positive notion of
\enquote{absence of central authority} and \enquote{lack of cooperation}.
\par
All scenarios studied in this thesis have in common
that players 
have to allocate resources
in order to perform certain tasks,
and that each possible configuration can be evaluated 
from the perspective of each player (\term{individual cost})
and from a global perspective (\term{social cost}).
\term{Equilibria} are configurations in which players 
do not have or do not see a way to improve their individual cost.
The \term{price of anarchy} is the social cost of a worst-case equilibrium
divided by that of a configuration with minimum social cost.
\par
In Part~I,
a network is given and players use it for routing.
The players' cost functions express the delay experienced
due to congested links.
In Part~II,
the network itself is formed in a distributed manner.
Building links on the one hand incurs a cost
but on the other hand also has a positive effect
since it improves connectivity.
Both aspects are incorporated into the players' cost functions.
