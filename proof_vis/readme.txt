For this thing to work, you need

- AutoIT (www.autoit.com)
- GraphVIZ

then create a vampviz.ini file in this folder with the content


[vampviz]
graphviz_path=C:\path\to\dot.exe
output_format=pdf
line_split=75


You can choose line splitting threshold for formulas
and change between svg, pdf, and other graphviz-supported output formulas.
